MAME4droid Reloaded (0.139 ) 1.2.1 (June 08, 2012) 
by David Valdeita (Seleuco)
=================================================================


INTRODUCTION
---------------

MAME4droid Reloaded is developed by David Valdeita (Seleuco), port of MAME 0.139 emulator by Nicola Salmoria and TEAM. 

MAME4droid Reloaded emulates arcade games supported by original MAME 0.139.

This MAME4droid version is targeted to Dual-Core devices (1GHz and 512MB RAM minimum), because it is based on a high specs 2010 PC MAME build.
Anyway don't expect arcade games of the 90 to work at full speed. With some games that are really bad optimized (like outrun or mk series) you will 
need at least a 1.5 ghz dual-core device (Cortex A15). This is related to MAME build used, since it is  targeted to high specs PC's as i said before. 
This version doesn't have an UML back-end ARM dynamic recompiler, which means drivers based on high specs arcade CPUs won't be playable 
(it has not sense since this games will be slow in any case).

Said that, with a low end device, use at your own risk. I suggest you use MAME4droid (0.37b5) instead.
Remember that games that can be emulated on both MAME4droid versions will run much faster on MAME4droid (0.37b5) than on MAME4droid Reloaded (0.139),
and will drain less battery.

This version emulates over 8000 different romsets. 

Please, try to understand that that with that amount of games, some will run better than others and some might not even run with MAME4droid Reloaded. 
Please, don't email me asking for a specific game to run.

Tips to help performance: Activate GL mode, use lower quality sound or switch it off. Disable stick and buttons animations and disable smooth scaling also.

After installing, place your MAME-titled zipped roms in /sdcard/ROMs/MAME4droid/roms folder.

MAME4droid Reloaded uses only '0.139' romset.

CONTROLS
-----------

The emulator controls are the following ones:
- Virtual pad: Movement in pad, mouse and analog control of the four players. 
- Buttons B,X,A,Y,L,R: Buttons A,B,C,D,E,F.
- Button SELECT (Coin): Insert credits (UP+SELECT = 2P credits, RIGHT+SELECT = 3P credits, DOWN+SELECT = 4P credits).
- Button START: start (UP+START = 2P start, RIGHT+START = 3P start, DOWN+START = 4P start).
- Buttons L2: Exit to selection menu to select another game.
- Buttons START+SELECT simultaneously: Access to the MAME menu.
- Button R2: Open help, global settings.

NOTE: To type OK when MAME requires it, press LEFT and then RIGHT.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
----------------

-Video render Mode: 

    * SW: SW render, more accurate. Higher device compatibility.
    * GL. Open GL ES 1.0 or upper. This should be your choice if it works fine for you. Faster rendering even with image filtering.

-Emulated Resolution: Force MAME internal drawing resolution, use hires resolution to improve artwork rendering at the expense of performance or to minimize 4:3 scaling artifacts. 

-Audio Sync. Enable it to get smoother gameplay and better sound in some cases. You should also disable Throttle, and set 6 or 8 manual frame skip if needed.

-Throttle: Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAME attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. Note that the fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially for older games.

-Frame Skip: Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2,then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is autoframekip that Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the game, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game running at full speed.
	 	 	
-Sound: Enable or disable sound altogether. Also Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause lower audio quality but faster emulation speed. Higher values (e.g. 48000) cause higher audio quality but slower emulation speed.
		 
-Show FPS: Shows ON/OFF fps.

-Show Info/Warnings: Shows Game Info and any warnings when a game is selected.

-Cheats: Enables the reading of the cheat database, if present, and the Cheat menu in the user interface.

-Change ROMs path: Change current ROMs path. You need to restart app. You must move roms from older folder to the new one also.

-Save battery: Allows MAME to give time back to the system (sleep) when running with -throttle. This allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running.

-Force Pixel Aspect: Enable it to force pixel aspect ratio bypassing MAME video selection.

-Customize touch layout: Select to customize landscape touch control layout. You should press 'back' when you finish.

-Default touch layout. Restore landscape control layout to default values.

-Buttons size. Select the buttons size when you are on fullscreen (landscape)

-Number of buttons (landscape) 1-4). Show 1-4 Buttons: Hide/show Y/A/X buttons if needed. Select A=B+X to use A button as B and X simultaneous press.

-Hide stick: Enable to hide stick on full screen mode.

-Define Keys. Let you define or map the HW keys to emulator controls. (Xperia Play and any other devices with physical keyboards users should configure their buttons or keys here)

-Defaults Keys. Restore key mappings to defaults.

-External Controller

   * Default. Select this value to use an external keyboard or devices based on keyboard IMES like WiiController.
   * iCade. Select this value to use iON's iCade controller. You should be bluetooth paired before.
   * iCP. Select this value to use ICP layout. iCP should be configured on iCade mode.

-Animated. Animates ON/OFF DPad/Stick. Disable to for better performance.

-Vibrate on keypress. Enable/Disable to let device vibrate when buttons or dpad/stick is touched.

-Touch Type:

     * Digital (DPAD). The controller is a digital DPAD. Some games need it or are better suited for this kind of controller.
     * Digital Stick (Old One). This is the old one faked analog stick.
     * Analog-Digital. (Performance). The controller is a full analog stick, MAME map it to a digital stick if needed. It's painted for performance.
     * Analog-Digital (Pretty). The controller is a full analog stick. 

-Stick Type: limits the joystick's range of motion: 8-way,4-way,2-way The most common reason to use a gate in an actual arcade setting is the retrofitting of an older machine that is not compatible with  a new 8-way stick. A classic example of this is Pac-Man. The game was originally designed for a 4-way stick, and is programmed  to respond only when a new input occurs. If the user is holding the stick in the down position, then suddenly makes a motion  to move to the right, what often happens is that the stick first moves into the down-right diagonal, which the game  does not recognize as new input since down is still being held. However, right is also now considered held, and when the user  completes the motion to move right, it is also not a new input, and Pac-Man will still be moving down.

-Digital Touch Dead Zone: Enable/Disable a deadzone on DPAD touch center. It could be better for some games. Disable if you don't like it.

-Analog Touch Dead Zone: Select the deadzone amount on stick touch center.

-P4,P3,P2 as P1. Send Player 1 input data to Player2,3,4 so you can use the 2-4 players at the same time. Funny :). It makes some weird problems with some roms like D&D.

-Trackball sensitivity: Set trackball persistance.

-Trackball fire only: Disable trackball movement.
   
-Tilt sensor. Enable to use tilt sensor as left/right.

-Tilt sensor dead zone.  Select the deadzone amount on tilt sensor.

-Tilt sensor sensitivity: Set tilt sensor sensitivity.  

-Scaling Mode:  
     
     * Original.
     * 1.5X: 1.5 original size. 
     * 2X: Double original size.
     * 2.5X: 2.5 original size. 
     * Keep Aspect: keeps the aspect ratio
     * Stretch to fit screen, will use all available screen.
     
-Filter overlay. Applies an image filter (scanlines or CRT) at the expense of performance.      

-Touch controller visible: Hide/Show the touch controller. Disable if you want to use an external controller like a keyboard or Wiimote.

-Smooth scaling: Turn on bitmap filtering at the expense of performance.

-Threaded Video render. Enable it to use a dedicate thread to do the video rendering (performance gain on double core devices). Disable if you have stuttering.

-Video thread priority. Set to default value unless you have problems. You need to restart.

-Double buffer. Avoids flickering at the expenses of performance.

-Main thread priority. Set to default value unless you have problems. You need to restart.

-Sound Latency. Set the audio buffer. Set to high if you have sound glitches. Lower is better.

-Force OpenGL ES 1.0. Enable it to use the old OpenGL 1.0 render path. Select it if you have performance problems with 2.0 render path. 

-Debug Mode. Enable debug mode. Only for developers.
